This is a brief introduction to Resonate’s technology landscape aimed to help volunteers feel a little more at home and find a place to get started.

It tries to provide a ‘big picture’ of our technology beginning with a little recap of context, the ‘why’, the purpose of Resonate…  and the implications of that for our technology

It then covers the ‘what’ Resonate technology needs to do to to fulfil that purpose, and..

the ‘how’ and ‘where’ we do that today (our current architecture) and how we will do that in future (the target architecture) along with all the links to the various github repositories and working documents in our Basecamp (current internal project tool)

Hope that helps! Please add comments / suggestions and edits to this document so that it’s better and more complete for the next reader!
